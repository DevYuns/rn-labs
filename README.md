# rn-labs

Learning labs for deep-diving into React Native systems, native platforms, and runtime internals.

## Goals
- Document hands-on experiments across C++, iOS, Android, and RN internals
- Build reusable templates for concurrency, rendering, and architecture patterns
- Automate CI/CD pipelines to support rapid iteration on native integrations

## Roadmap
Detailed milestones and timelines live in [docs/roadmap.md](./docs/roadmap.md).
